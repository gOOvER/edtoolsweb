## Overview

Calculate optimal neutron star routes for long-distance travel in Elite Dangerous. Plan efficient jumps using neutron star boosts to dramatically increase your jump range and reduce travel time.

## Key Features

### ‚ö° **Neutron Boost Routing**
- Calculate routes using neutron star supercharging
- Plan multi-thousand light-year journeys efficiently
- Optimize for minimum jumps or safest route

### üìç **Intelligent Waypoints**
- Automatic waypoint generation every 1000ly
- Safe harbor stations for repairs and refueling
- Alternative routes when neutron stars unavailable

### üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Features**
- Exclude damaged or dangerous neutron stars
- Include repair stations in long routes
- Emergency jump calculations

### üìä **Route Analysis**
- Total distance and estimated travel time
- Fuel requirements and consumption analysis
- Jump range requirements and recommendations

## How to Use

1. **Set Start & Destination**: Enter your current system and target destination
2. **Configure Ship**: Input your ship's jump range and fuel capacity
3. **Choose Options**: Select safety level and route preferences
4. **Generate Route**: Get optimized neutron highway route
5. **Export Waypoints**: Download for your preferred navigation tool

## Route Planning Options

### **Efficiency Modes**
- **Fastest**: Maximum neutron boost usage, shortest time
- **Safest**: Include repair stations, avoid risky stars
- **Balanced**: Optimal mix of speed and safety

### **Ship Configuration**
- Jump range (laden/unladen)
- Fuel tank capacity
- FSD booster equipped
- Guardian FSD booster level

## Neutron Highway Networks

### **Major Routes**
- **Sol to Colonia**: ~22,000ly via neutron highway
- **Bubble to Sagittarius A***: Central galactic route
- **Outer Rim Explorer**: Circumnavigation routes
- **Guardian Space**: Ancient ruins exploration

### **Safety Considerations**

!!! danger "Neutron Star Risks"
    Neutron stars can damage your FSD and other modules. Always carry repair materials!

!!! warning "Fuel Management"
    Plan fuel stops carefully. Some neutron routes have long gaps between fuel stars.

!!! tip "Route Backup"
    Always have alternative routes planned in case of ship damage or route changes.

## Integration Features

- **EDSM Integration**: Real-time neutron star data
- **Fleet Carrier Support**: Include carrier positions in routing
- **Navigation Export**: Compatible with ED Discovery, EDMC
- **Live Updates**: Dynamic routing based on current galactic data

## Expert Tips

### **Before You Go**
- Equip AFMU (Auto Field-Maintenance Unit)
- Carry synthesis materials for FSD injection
- Plan overnight stops at stations
- Check for community goals affecting routes

### **During Travel**
- Monitor FSD health after each boost
- Use synthesis materials when needed
- Take screenshots at notable locations
- Share discoveries with the community
